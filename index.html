            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my webpage! Here's some information about me.
                <br>
               I am currently an undergraduate finalist at the University of Bath, studying Mathematics and Physics. I am interested in pursuing a PhD in physics, in the fields I expand upon below.
               I have always had a strong interest in pursuing physics at a high level through the joy of solving problems, the possibility of learning about how the universe works the way it does, 
               and due to the potential of impacting the world in a positive way. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My primary research interests are dual. I am keenly interested in the applications of lasers in physics: the <i>extreme</i> interaction of light with matter. In particular,
             I am fascinated by the physics of laser-wakefield acceleration and exploring potential applications of fusion for energy production, given its relevance to societal 
             needs for affordable energy while mitigating contributions to climate change. I anticipate that delving into fusion research will inevitably uncover captivating and 
             deeply interesting physics and is one of the most important challenges for our species to overcome this century.
            <br>
            My other key line of interest is with our theory of gravity. I am particularly interested in gaining and contributing to an understanding of gravity which encapsulates
             dark matter and dark energy. I believe the existence, or lack of existence, of dark matter is one of the most fascinating fundamental questions of our time and it is
             for this reason I would love to undertake research on it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I constantly uphold myself to high standards and am self-motivated to complete tasks, as I have shown through my extended project work at Vulcan.

            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p>At present, I have two scientific publications, both from my time working at the Vulcan laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, which have been submitted to journals and are in the review process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./Files/Spectral_Interferometry_Temporal_Stabilisation.pdf" target="_blank">Sub-10-attosecond Fibre-length Stabilisation using
                    Phase-locked Spectral Interferometry.</a> This was the main body of work undertaken whilst on placement at Vulcan. Path-length synchronisation
                     is important for instance in next generation laser facilities, where the delay between pulses aims to be controlled to the femtosecond regime. 
                     We investigated path-length stabilisation using phase-locked spectral interferometry, and achieved stabilisation results sub-10 attoseconds.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="./Files/2Hz_Pump_Stability.pdf" target="_blank">Automated Long-Term Stability of a High Energy Laser.</a> In this work I developed a
                    stand-alone software in C# which controlled the rotation of a half wave-plate prior to having its polarisation redefined. In this way the energy
                    of a pump laser to an OPCPA system was regulated to a desired set-energy, which prevented damage in the system. The code is available on the
