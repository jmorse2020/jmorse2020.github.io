                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my webpage!
                    <br>
                I have recently completed my BSc in Maths and Physics at the University of Bath. In October I hope to be starting my PhD at Imperial College in high powered OPCPA lasers in the mid IR and their applications. My hopes with this research are to help in the development of the next generation of high powered short-pulse lasers. I am also interested in taking theoretical courses in nonlinear optics, QED, as well as other courses in my own time on fluid dynamics and advanced GR.
                I hope to be able to think about dark matter and dark energy, as I find their illusiveness curious. But I also hope my research can lead to positive developments, directly or indirectly, for instance in sustainable energy generation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Separately from physics I am interested in politics, and I do some personal programming projects. I hope to expand this website in the near future with some of my thoughts on politics, and to outline more of my interests.

                I completed a placement year in 2022/23 at Vulcan in the UK's Central Laser Facility. Some of the work I completed there is outlined below.

                <h2>Publications</h2>
                <p>At present, I have two scientific publications, both from my time working at the Vulcan laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, which have been submitted to journals and are in the review process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="./Files/Spectral_Interferometry_Temporal_Stabilisation.pdf" target="_blank">[Pre-print] Sub-10-attosecond Fibre-length Stabilisation using
                        Phase-locked Spectral Interferometry.</a> This was the main body of work undertaken whilst on placement at Vulcan. Path-length synchronisation
                        is important for instance in next generation laser facilities, where the delay between pulses aims to be controlled to the femtosecond regime. 
                        We investigated path-length stabilisation using phase-locked spectral interferometry, and achieved stabilisation results sub-10 attoseconds.

                    <br>
                    <li><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3269/4/4/44" target="_blank">Automated Long-Term Stability of a High Energy Laser.</a> In this work I developed a
                        stand-alone software in C# which controlled the rotation of a half wave-plate prior to having its polarisation redefined. In this way the energy
                        of a pump laser to an OPCPA system was regulated to a desired set-energy, which prevented damage in the system. The code is available on the

                <p>My undergraduate final year project was on simulating mid-IR photon generation in gas-filled hollow core fibres:</p>
