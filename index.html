            <h1>Jack Morse</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a PhD student researching ultrafast physics, with a focus on developing and applying 
                mid-infrared Optical Parametric Chirped Pulse Amplification (OPCPA) systems. 
                My work explores high-intensity laserâ€“matter interactions, particularly 
                <strong>laser wakefield acceleration</strong> and <strong>high harmonic generation</strong>. 
                I also investigate the role of <strong>temporal contrast</strong> in high-power laser systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside the lab, I'm passionate about building a fairer, more just world. I believe 
                scientific insight and social consciousness should go hand in hand. You can read 
                some of my thoughts on these topics in the <a href="blog.html">blog</a> section.

                <h2>Publications</h2>
                <p>At present, I have two scientific publications, both from my time working at the Vulcan laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, which have been submitted to journals and are in the review process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="./Files/Spectral_Interferometry_Temporal_Stabilisation.pdf" target="_blank">[Pre-print] Sub-10-attosecond Fibre-length Stabilisation using
                        Phase-locked Spectral Interferometry.</a> This was the main body of work undertaken whilst on placement at Vulcan. Path-length synchronisation
                        is important for instance in next generation laser facilities, where the delay between pulses aims to be controlled to the femtosecond regime. 
                        We investigated path-length stabilisation using phase-locked spectral interferometry, and achieved stabilisation results sub-10 attoseconds.

                    <br>
                    <li><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-3269/4/4/44" target="_blank">Automated Long-Term Stability of a High Energy Laser.</a> In this work I developed a
                        stand-alone software in C# which controlled the rotation of a half wave-plate prior to having its polarisation redefined. In this way the energy
                        of a pump laser to an OPCPA system was regulated to a desired set-energy, which prevented damage in the system. The code is available on the

                <h2>Dissertation</h2>
                <p>My undergraduate final year project was on simulating mid-IR photon generation in gas-filled hollow core fibres:</p>
                <ul>
