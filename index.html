            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my webpage! Here's some information about me.
                <br>
               I am currently an undergraduate finalist at the University of Bath, studying Mathematics and Physics. I have always had a strong interest in pursuing physics
             	at a high level through the joy of solving problems, the possibility of learning about how the universe works the way it does, and due to the potential of impacting the
                world in a positive way. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My main research interests include the <i>extreme</i> interactions of light with matter. For example I am interested in physics of laser wakefield acceleration, and also possible applications in fusion for energy production due to its pertinence
            in society to provide affordable energy without further contribution to Climate Change.
            <br>
            <br>
            I constantly uphold myself to high standards and am self motivated to complete tasks, as I have shown through my project work at Vulcan.

            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p>At present, I have two scientific publications, both from my time working at the Vulcan laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, which have been submitted to journals and are in the review process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./Files/Spectral_Interferometry_Temporal_Stabilisation.pdf" target="_blank">Sub-10-attosecond Fibre-length Stabilisation using
                    Phase-locked Spectral Interferometry.</a> This was the main body of work undertaken whilst on placement at Vulcan. Path-length synchronisation
                     is important for instance in next generation laser facilities, where the delay between pulses aims to be controlled to the femtosecond regime. 
                     We investigated path-length stabilisation using phase-locked spectral interferometry, and achieved stabilisation results sub-10 attoseconds.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="./Files/2Hz_Pump_Stability.pdf" target="_blank">Automated Long-Term Stability of a High Energy Laser.</a> In this work I developed a
                    stand-alone software in C# which controlled the rotation of a half wave-plate prior to having its polarisation redefined. In this way the energy
                    of a pump laser to an OPCPA system was regulated to a desired set-energy, which prevented damage in the system. The code is available on the
